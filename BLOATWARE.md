## Bloatware Cleanup (2025-09-09)


### Removed (2025-09-09)

- All `console.debug`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` statements from:
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
   - `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - `src/components/AuthScreen.tsx`
   - `src/lib/email.ts`
   - `src/lib/events.ts`
   - `src/api/sendEmail.ts`
- All `setTimeout` bloatware for loading state from:
   - `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
   - `src/components/Dashboard.new.tsx`

### Rationale

- Logging was added for debugging auth, routing, and state issues. Now that the flow is stable, these logs are removed to reduce console noise and improve performance.
- `setTimeout` for loading was unnecessary and replaced with direct state updates for instant feedback.

### Safe to Remove

- All removed code was non-functional and for debugging or artificial loading only. No production logic was affected.
### 7. Robust dashboard redirect after login (fixed)
- **Problem:** After login, the app could reload the auth session but not grant access to the dashboard, leaving the user stuck on the auth page or in a blank state.
- **Fix:** The `ProtectedRoute` now always redirects authorized users to the dashboard, regardless of the previous page. Verbose logging was added to trace all state transitions. This eliminates race conditions and ensures a smooth login experience.

### 8. Bloatware cleanup in auth/dashboard routing
- **Fix:** Removed redundant navigation logic and ensured all state transitions are handled in a single place. All navigation and state changes are now logged for traceability. No unnecessary or duplicate logic remains in the login/logout/dashboard routing flow.
### 5. Logout stuck in loading (fixed)
- **Problem:** After logout, the UI could remain stuck in a loading state because `isLoading` was not reset.
- **Fix:** The `logout` action in the store now always sets `isLoading: false` to guarantee the UI is never stuck loading after logout.

### 6. Logout bloatware cleanup
- **Fix:** Ensured logout clears all state, resets navigation, unsubscribes from realtime, and resets loading. No unnecessary logic or state remains in the logout flow.

   ## Fixes Applied: Prevent blank loading screen

   ## Database & State Bloatware / Race Condition Audit

   ### 1. Race condition in authentication (fixed)
   - **Problem:** Both `initAuth` and `onAuthStateChange` in `use-auth.ts` could set/clear the user, causing a race where the user is cleared after successful login, resulting in a blank page.
   - **Fix:** Now only `onAuthStateChange` sets/clears the user. `initAuth` only sets loading or sets user if the auth event hasn't fired. See `use-auth.ts` for details.


   ### 2. Redundant/duplicate event and guest fetches (partially fixed)
   - **Observation:** `setUser` in the store triggers an events fetch, and `use-realtime.ts` also fetches events/guests on subscription. This can cause unnecessary network calls and state churn.
   - **Fix:** Realtime event/guest updates now update only the changed record in the store, not the entire list. Removed mock data from the store. Further optimization: only fetch events/guests once per navigation or subscription.

   ### 3. Zustand store mock data (fixed)
   - **Problem:** `mockEvents` and `mockGuests` were present in `usePartyStore.ts` but not used in production.
   - **Fix:** Removed mock data from the store file.

   ### 4. Zustand setEvents/setGuests usage (fixed)
   - **Problem:** Used functional set syntax, which Zustand does not support for custom actions.
   - **Fix:** Now gets current state from store, updates array, and calls setEvents/setGuests with new array.

   ### 3. Mock data in store
   - **Observation:** `mockEvents` and `mockGuests` are present in `usePartyStore.ts` but not used in production. 
   - **Recommendation:** Remove or isolate mock data to development-only files to avoid confusion and bloat.

   ### 4. Store state resets
   - **Observation:** On user logout or error, the store resets all state, which is correct. However, if multiple async actions run in parallel (e.g., event fetch and guest fetch), state can be briefly inconsistent.
   - **Recommendation:** Consider using React Query for all server state and Zustand only for UI state, to avoid race conditions and ensure cache consistency.

   ### 5. Realtime subscriptions
   - **Observation:** `use-realtime.ts` subscribes to both events and guests channels, and fetches all guests/events on every change. This can be optimized to only update the changed record, not refetch all data.
   - **Recommendation:** Use the payload from the realtime event to update only the affected event/guest in the store, rather than refetching the entire list.

   ---
   **Summary:**
   - Race condition in auth flow fixed (see above).
   - Redundant fetches and mock data should be cleaned up for production.
   - Realtime updates can be optimized to reduce bloat and network usage.

   1. `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Do not throw on missing env vars
      - Problem: importing supabase client threw during module import when env vars were missing. That caused Vite/HMR to fail and the app to show a blank page.
      - Fix: changed the module to warn and create the client with empty strings. This prevents module import failure and allows runtime handling.

   2. `src/hooks/use-auth.ts` - Hardened auth initialization
      - Problem: `getSession()` or `onAuthStateChange` could hang or the app could wait indefinitely if the promise never resolved or if subscriptions weren't set properly.
      - Fixes:
        - Added a 5s timeout race for `getSession()` so the UI will not hang forever.
        - Added debug logging to surface lifecycle events in the console.
        - Guarded subscriptions with `isSubscribed` and safe unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks.
        - Hardened `useUser()` hook similarly with a timeout and safe subscription handling.

   3. Component cleanup
      - Replaced duplicate `Dashboard.tsx` with the improved `Dashboard.new.tsx` implementation to eliminate syntax inconsistencies that caused build-time parsing errors.

   Why these fixes help:
   - They prevent import-time throws that break the dev server and cause blank screens.
   - They guard against long-running or unresolved async calls that previously left `isLoading` stuck true.
   - They add diagnostics so remaining issues surface as console logs rather than silent failure.

   Next recommended steps:
   - Add unit tests for auth hooks (mock Supabase). 
   - Add CI check to fail when env vars required for production aren't provided, but do not crash dev environment.
   - Replace console logs with a proper telemetry/error tracking solution in production (Sentry, LogRocket).
