Of course. Expanding PartyHaus to include a comprehensive, customizable gaming platform is an excellent strategic move that would significantly differentiate it in the market. This transforms the app from a logistics tool into the central entertainment hub for the event itself.

Here is a detailed discussion and design for the game curation and gameplay interfaces, starting with a robust "cold start" library of game templates.

### **Phase 1: The Game Library (The "Cold Start" Content)**

To empower hosts, PartyHaus needs a rich library of game templates they can select and customize. Here are 30 ideas, categorized for easy filtering, that can be curated for any event.

#### **Category 1: Icebreakers & Social Mixers**

*Goal: Get guests talking and moving around.*

1.  **Party Bingo:** Guests get a digital bingo card with squares like "Find someone who has a pet," "Find someone who speaks another language." They mingle to find people who match and get their digital signature.
2.  **Two Truths and a Lie:** The app collects three statements from each guest and presents them anonymously for the group to vote on the lie.
3.  **Photo Scavenger Hunt:** A list of photo prompts appears (e.g., "A photo of the best dancer," "A selfie with someone you just met"). Guests upload photos to the live feed.
4.  **Who Am I?:** The app assigns each guest a famous person's name, visible to everyone *except* the guest. The guest asks yes/no questions to the group to guess who they are.
5.  **Human Knot (Digital Prompt):** A fun, simple prompt where the app instructs guests to form a circle and grab hands with two different people, then try to untangle.
6.  **"Never Have I Ever":** The app provides safe-for-work prompts. Guests indicate if they have or haven't done it. The app reveals fun stats about the group.

#### **Category 2: Quizzes & Trivia**

*Goal: Test knowledge in a fun, competitive way.*
7\.  **Birthday Star Trivia:** The host curates questions about the guest of honour.
8\.  **General Knowledge Quiz:** A classic quiz with categories like history, geography, and literature.
9\.  **Science & Nature Quiz:** Questions about biology, space, and the natural world.
10\. **Music Intro Quiz:** The app plays 10-second clips of songs; players guess the title and artist.
11\. **Movie Quotes & Taglines:** Guess the movie from a famous quote or poster tagline.
12\. **Pop Culture Quiz:** Questions about recent trends, celebrities, and events.
13\. **"Guess the Year":** The app shows a photo of an event or a collage of items, and players have to guess the year it was taken.

#### **Category 3: Creative & Performance Games**

*Goal: Encourage humour, creativity, and a bit of performance.*
14\. **Pictionary (Phone Edition):** The app gives a player a prompt to draw on their phone screen, which is mirrored to a central TV. Their team guesses.
15\. **"Witty Response" (Bad Libs):** The app provides a fill-in-the-blank prompt. Players submit their funniest answers, and a rotating judge picks the winner.
16\. **Meme Maker:** The app provides a popular meme image. Players add their own funny caption. The group votes for the best one.
17\. **Story Chain:** The app starts a story with one sentence. Each player adds the next sentence, creating a bizarre and hilarious narrative.
18\. **Charades:** The app provides the prompts directly to the player's phone, eliminating the need for a bowl of paper.
19\. **"Guess the Drawing":** Similar to Pictionary, but one person draws and all players guess the prompt by typing it in. Fastest correct guess wins.

#### **Category 4: Truth, Dare & "What If?"**

*Goal: Classic party fun with structured, app-moderated prompts.*
20\. **Classic Truth or Dare:** The host can pre-approve a list of age-appropriate prompts.
21\. **"Would You Rather?":** The app presents two absurd or difficult choices. Players vote, and the app shows the group's split decision.
22\. **Dare Roulette:** The app presents a "spinning wheel" of dares. One player is chosen to spin and perform the dare it lands on.

#### **Category 5: High-Tech & Immersive Experiences**

*Goal: Leverage technology for a "wow" factor experience.*
23\. **AR Mystery Hunt:** The flagship game. The host places digital clues on real-world objects. Guests use their phone cameras to find and solve them.
24\. **QR Code Treasure Hunt:** A simpler version where the host prints and hides QR codes that lead to the next riddle or location within the app.
25\. **Digital Escape Room (Lite):** A series of interconnected riddles and puzzles presented in the app that guests must solve in a specific order to "escape" within a time limit.
26\. **Live Polling & Voting:** Quick, fun polls the host can launch anytime (e.g., "Vote for the party's best-dressed guest," "What music genre should we play next?").
27\. **Sound Match:** The app plays a sound effect, and players have to choose what it is from a list of options.
28\. **Who's the Party Crasher? (Social Deduction):** The app secretly assigns one player as the "crasher." Through guided rounds of discussion and voting, the group tries to identify them.
29\. **The Insider:** A cooperative game where guests ask a "master" yes/no questions to guess a secret word. However, one "insider" guest secretly knows the word and must guide the group without being discovered.
30\. **Prop Hunt:** The app gives a player a secret common object in the room (e.g., "a blue cushion"). The player must answer yes/no questions from the group to help them guess what the object is.

### **Phase 2: The Interface for Game Curation (Host's View)**

This interface, let's call it the **"Game Lab,"** is where the host plans the event's entertainment. It needs to be intuitive and powerful.

**Design and Flow:**

1.  **Access Point:** Within the `Host Event Management Dashboard`, a new tab or prominent section appears: **"Game Lab"**.

2.  **Main Layout:** A two-panel layout works best.

      * **Left Panel: Game Library:** This is a browsable, filterable list of all the game templates detailed above.
      * **Right Panel: Your Event Playlist:** This is where the host drags and drops the games they've selected for their specific party.

3.  **Key UI Elements in the Game Lab:**

      * **Search Bar:** "Search for a game..."
      * **Filters:** Interactive buttons to filter the library by:
          * **Age:** `All Ages`, `Kids`, `Teens`, `Adults`
          * **Type:** `Icebreaker`, `Trivia`, `Creative`, `AR/VR`
          * **Energy Level:** `Low Key`, `Moderate`, `High Energy`
      * **Game Template Cards:** Each game in the library is a card with:
          * An icon and the game's title.
          * A short description ("A team-based drawing and guessing game.").
          * An "Add to Playlist" button.
      * **Event Playlist Area:**
          * A drag-and-drop list showing the selected games.
          * Each game in the playlist has two options: a **"Customize"** button and a "Remove" button.

4.  **The Customization Modal (The Core Logic):**

      * Clicking "Customize" opens a pop-up modal specific to that game type. This is where the host curates the content.
      * **For a Quiz:** The modal shows a list of default questions. The host can delete them, edit them, or click "Add New Question" to type their own.
      * **For Truth or Dare:** It shows a list of pre-written prompts. The host can uncheck any they don't like and add their own to a text box.
      * **For the AR Mystery Hunt:** This is the most complex. The modal would guide the host:
          * `Step 1: Add a Clue Location.` The host's phone camera opens.
          * `Step 2: Scan an object at your venue (e.g., a painting).`
          * `Step 3: Add the clue for this location (e.g., "Your next clue is where the music lives!").`
          * The host repeats this process to build the entire hunt.

### **Phase 3: The Interface for Live Gameplay (During the Party)**

This interface, **"Party Mode,"** needs to be extremely simple and engaging for guests.

**Design and Flow:**

1.  **Activation (Host's View):**

      * On the event dashboard, the host sees their "Game Playlist."
      * Next to the first game, there's a big, glowing **"Start Game"** button.

2.  **Joining the Game (Guest's View):**

      * All scanned-in guests receive a push notification and a banner appears in their app: **"The host has started Party Bingo\! Tap to Join."**
      * Tapping the notification takes their screen over into the game interface.

3.  **The Gameplay Screen:**

      * The design is minimal to focus on the action.
      * **For a Quiz:** The screen shows the question, a countdown timer, and large, tappable buttons for the answers (A, B, C, D).
      * **For Pictionary:** The drawing player sees the prompt and a simple canvas. Guessing players see the drawing fullscreen and a text box to type their answers.
      * **For the AR Hunt:** The screen activates the camera with an overlay showing the current riddle and a scanner to find the next clue.

4.  **Central/TV Display:**

      * For group games like trivia, the host can open a special "Display Mode" URL on a laptop connected to a TV. This screen shows leaderboards, the current question, and winning answers, creating a shared focal point for the party.

5.  **Between Rounds & Post-Game:**

      * The guest's screen shows leaderboards, funny stats ("56% of you would rather fight a horse-sized duck\!"), or the winning meme from the last round.
      * It then displays a "Waiting for the host to start the next game..." message, returning control to the host's app.

By building this integrated gaming system, PartyHaus would offer a powerful, end-to-end solution that not only simplifies planning but actively creates the memorable moments that make a party great.
